1) Inverted Vs_exp,Vd_exp,k_exp,R5log,R3,condd. 
Known quantity pt (topographic component) and conds
Dataset: tilts (not GPS on the collapse).
It works and produce nice PDF

2) Inverted Vs_exp,Vd_exp,k_exp,R5log,R3,condd. 
Known quantity pt (topographic component) and conds
Dataset: tilts and GPS
GPS error: 1e-2
Does not work bimodal gaussian, and true value of some parameters is on the edge of the gaussian

Thought: Does it depends on the fact that synth GPS has NO noise and the proposed error is large?
Try with lower GPS error


2) Inverted Vs_exp,Vd_exp,k_exp,R5log,R3,condd. 
Known quantity pt (topographic component) and conds
Dataset: tilts and GPS
GPS error: 1e-3
Does not work: bimodal gaussian, become worse than GPS err 1e-2
