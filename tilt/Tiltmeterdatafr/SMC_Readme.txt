Tiltmeter: Applied Geomechanics LILY (digital)
Latitude:   19.40612
Longitude: -155.25736
Instrument Depth: 2.5 meters

Translation equation applied for X-Y to E-N tilt: 
Etilt = (cos(Az)*cX*Xtilt)+(sin(Az)*cY*Ytilt)
Ntilt = (-sin(Az)*cX*Xtilt)+(cos(Az)*cY*Ytilt)
cX=1, cY=1, Az=0 degrees


SMC_20180430T000000-20180529T024700.csv:
Telemetry to the tiltmeter was lost on May 25 due to ash deposits at the Sandhill radio repeater site.  At about the same time the tiltmeterâ€™s east component maxxed our, leaving only the north component on-scale
             
SMC_20180529T024800-20180529T130400.csv:
The tiltmeter was releveled during a site visit on May 29, but entered a non-operational state 11 hours later.
Estimated: Xoff=-327.7 mrad  Yoff=-100 mrad

SMC_20180529T130500-20180610T060900.csv:
On May 31, telemetry was re-established via cell modem, the tiltmeter was reprogrammed, and once again re-leveled.  The end of this file has a ~8 hour data gap for the north component only, while it awaited the next re-level.
Estimated: Xoff=-333 mrad  Yoff=-80 mrad

SMC_20180610T061000-20180623T021100.csv:
Re-leveled on June 10. The end of this file has a ~23 hour data gap for the east component only.
Estimated: Xoff=-424.9 mrad  Yoff=-430 mrad

SMC_20180623T021200-20180624T203500.csv:
Re-leveled on June 23, the again on June 24, without significant data gap.
Estimated: Xoff=-754.9 mrad  Yoff=-422.3 mrad

SMC_20180624T203600-20180629T201100.csv:
Re-leveled on June 24, this iteration lasted for 5 days and ends with a 29 hour gap on the east component.
Estimated: Xoff=-1008 mrad  Yoff=-533.8 mrad

SMC_20180629T201200-20180720T055100.csv:
Re-leveled on June 29, no significant data gap at the end of this file.
Estimated: Xoff=-1339.8 mrad  Yoff=-248.8 mrad

SMC_20180720T055200-20180805T000000.csv:
Re-level on July 20, lasted until the end of collapse events.
Estimated: Xoff=-1538.9 mrad  Yoff=-108.2 mrad
