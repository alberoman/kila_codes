Tiltmeter: Applied Geomechanics (analog)
Latitude: 19.391337
Longitude: -155.108499
Instrument Depth: #.# meters

Translation equation applied for X-Y to E-N tilt: 
Etilt = (cos(Az)*cX*Xtilt)+(sin(Az)*cY*Ytilt)
Ntilt = (-sin(Az)*cX*Xtilt)+(cos(Az)*cY*Ytilt)
cX=99.80000256, cY=100.09999872, Az=5 degrees


POC_20180430T000000-20180805T000000.csv:
The Y-component of the POC tiltmeter were off-scale soon after the collapse of Pu’u ‘O’o, at 12:56AM UTC on 5-1-2018 (2:56PM HST on 4-30-2018). At 2:03AM UTC on 5–01-2018 (4:03PM HST on 4-30-2018), the Y-component came back on-scale, almost simulataneously with the X-component going off-scale.  The X-component remained off-scale for the remainder of the eruption.  Tiltmeter POO is located 1.5 km WSW of POC.  POO is not as sensitive to Pu’u ‘O’o’s shallow magma system as POC is, but may be a useful alternative.  


A note on spikes: The bubble levels in these tiltmeters are very sensitive and shaking from an earthquake or collapse event can cause sloshing of the bubble level.  Beware of interpreting spikes or other short time-span features, which may be artifacts of shaking and not true local tilt changes.  Sloshing of the bubble level during an earthquake can also easily put the bubble level off-scale, such that the magnitude of spikes is influenced by how close the bubble is to the side of the level.  This can be seen in the one-sided character of some earthquake spikes, the bubble can only freely slosh to one side.
