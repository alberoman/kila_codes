Tiltmeter: Applied Geomechanics Lily (digital)
Latitude: 119.4336
Longitude: -155.00445
Instrument Depth: 4.8 meters

Translation equation applied for X-Y to E-N tilt: 
Etilt = (cos(Az)*cX*Xtilt)+(sin(Az)*cY*Ytilt)
Ntilt = (-sin(Az)*cX*Xtilt)+(cos(Az)*cY*Ytilt)
cX=49.9, cY=50, Az=0 degrees

The Y-component (North) of tiltmeter JKA went off-scale coincident with the M5.7 earthquake on May 4, 2018 (a foreshock of the M6.9).  The tiltmeter wasnâ€™t releveled until May 7, 2018.  After this time, the tiltmeter remained on-scale.

A note on spikes: The bubble levels in these tiltmeters are very sensitive and shaking from an earthquake or collapse event can cause sloshing of the bubble level.  Beware of interpreting spikes or other short time-span features, which may be artifacts of shaking and not true local tilt changes.  Sloshing of the bubble level during an earthquake can also easily put the bubble level off-scale, such that the magnitude of spikes is influenced by how close the bubble is to the end of the scale.  This can be seen in the one-sided character of some earthquake spikes; the bubble can only freely slosh to one side.
