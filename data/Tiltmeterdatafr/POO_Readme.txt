Tiltmeter: Applied Geomechanics (analog)
Latitude: 19.395092
Longitude: -155.122246
Instrument Depth: #.# meters

Translation equation applied for X-Y to E-N tilt: 
Etilt = (cos(Az)*cX*Xtilt)+(sin(Az)*cY*Ytilt)
Ntilt = (-sin(Az)*cX*Xtilt)+(cos(Az)*cY*Ytilt)
cX=50.8, cY=50.2, Az=312 degrees

A note on spikes: The bubble levels in these tiltmeters are very sensitive and shaking from an earthquake or collapse event can cause sloshing of the bubble level.  Beware of interpreting spikes or other short time-span features, which may be artifacts of shaking and not true local tilt changes.  Sloshing of the bubble level during an earthquake can also easily put the bubble level off-scale, such that the magnitude of spikes is influenced by how close the bubble is to the side of the level.  This can be seen in the one-sided character of some earthquake spikes, the bubble can only freely slosh to one side.
